	Thanks a lot for your efforts.  It was kind of interesting
to read your code.   This fall I intend to start working on developing
the new version of the system, and one thought involves building part of
it in Scheme.  If so, I'll dig up your code again to see if we can
start from it.
	Take care - hope to talk to you soon.

Steve
