;; ok, I give up.  I will use CL standard losing case insensitivity
;; so that GCL will work, at least for the moment.

;; Allegro had it right prior to the standard, but had to yield. The
;; result, that the case-sensitive stuff did not always work in later
;; releases, seems to  makes it advisable to just use case-insensitive-upper.
;; it also increases compatibility with other CLs  RJF. 10/30/97

;;; *** fix for issue with incomplete prompt  /+kfp 18-mar-2025
; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45803936/call-finish-output-from-format
; A suggestion from Rob Warnock
; Actually, no changes to format are needed. Just add this function somewhere 
; in the COMMON-LISP-USER package:

(in-package :cl-user)
       (defun fo (stream arg colon-p atsign-p &rest params)
         (declare (ignore arg params))
        (cond
          (colon-p (force-output stream))
          (atsign-p (clear-output stream))
          (t (finish-output stream))))

; then use ~/fo/ in format consuming a nil.

#| GCL does not have readtable-case, which is a pain.

  This list provides data so that if the user types in If, and the GCL
  version of the parser reads it as IF, then a suitable program knows
  that it is really the symbol If.  Of course if the user types in IF
  and intends it to be IF, not If, we lose. A way around it by
  simulating the lisp reader is too painful.  We depend upon it for
  lexical analysis.  Except for Scieneer Lisp, other implementations
  we know of do not provide the Franz/Allegro "modern" mode, and so
  accessing a Lisp program, say print, requires currently typing
  PRINT[..], because that's its name, and we can't auto-uppercase it
  without making a hash of MockMMA compatibility with Mathematica. And
  it is displayed as PRINT. This is visually distracting.  Modern mode
  renames the built-in system functions in lower-case, so print is
  simply print. 

  Oh, maybe we will hack both input and output so that identifiers all
of one case are mapped all to the other case on input, and are
are remapped back to the other case on output.  Thus print becomes
PRINT internally, and  foobar becomes FOOBAR internally. The Maxima
computer algebra system does something like this.
