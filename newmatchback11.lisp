;;; definition: a patternobject is like an expression but it can
;;; have (Pattern ...) or PatternTest or PatternSequence or etc in it.
;;; Actually, any expression can be used as a pattern, but it would
;;; match only itself.  This is useful too.

;;; there is special attention given to a variety of situations.

;;; first of all, there are external conditions, sometimes.
;;; (x_->f[x])/; pred[x]
;;; is Condition[Rule[x_,f[x]] , pred[x]]
;;; which means that we must consider matching (and possibly failing/rematching)
;;; x subject to the condition pred[x].
;;; 

;; sic = subject to inherited conditions

;;; All that matches here
;;; (a) structurally identical matches. [sic]
;;; (b) (Blank) matches <anything> [sic]
;;;     (Blank foo) matches anything with a Head of foo [usually the car)
;;;     but also if foo is in {Integer, Rational, Complex, rat...?}
;;; matching rational or complex requires some special deconstruction of these.
;;; program is in ReplaceAll, but maybe should be somewhere else like Replace.

;;; (c) (Pattern x <patternobject>) matches whatever would
;;;   otherwise be matched by <patternobject> and also binds the value of
;;;   patternobject to the name x.  From that time onward during the match
;;;   x will only match identical items. [sic]
;;; (d) [must fix]
;;;    f[pat1, pat2, ...,patn] matches expression f[e1,e2, ..., en] {sic} if
;;; f matches f, and pat1 matches e1 subject to the conditions:
;;; {pat2, ...,patn} matches {e2, ...,en}  [sic]
;;; recursively. 
;;; {} matches {} [sic]
;;; This is only the simple case, since if p1 is a BlankSequence it can absorb
;;; one OR MORE of e1, e2 ...  If p1 is a BlankNullSequence it can absorb 0, one or more
;;; of e1, ...

;;; there is also a result of binding, that a variable
;;; can only match an expression consistently.
;;; f[x_,x_] will match f[3,3] but not f[3,4].
;;; f[x_,x_^2] will match f[a,a^2].  But not f[3,9]. (sorry).
;;; However, f[_,_]  matches f[3,4].

;;; check to see if the following is broken now.

;;; (d)  (BlankSequence ...) or __ inside (non-Orderless) functions. Note:
;;;  If f is "Flat" then f[a,x_] matches f[a,z,w]
;;;   with x-> f[z,w]. 
;;;  If f is "Flat" then f[b,x__] matches f[b,z,w]
;;;   with x-> Sequence[z,w] .  That's Sequence[z,w]. Look it up...

;;; (e) (BlankNullSequence ...) or ___ inside (non-Orderless) functions.

;;; (f) Orderless functions are matched only if they have a fixed
;;; number of arguments.

;;; (g) (PatternTest <patternobj> Test) matches whatever <patternobj> would
;;; match, but only if (Test <patternobj>) returns lisp t. 
;;;  (PatternTest x_ Test) is usually written x_?Test.
;;;Question:
;;; perhaps we should ask that (meval (list Test <patternobj>)) be True not t?
;;; we keep to t.

;;; g[x__,x__] matches g[1,2,3,1,2,3]  with x->(1,2,3)
;;; broken

;;; Some Flat functions are Plus, Times.  There are hardly any
;;; others.  They are also Orderless (see below) complicating
;;; the matching considerably.  

;;; Functions which are both Flat and Orderless functions are
;;; not handled by this version. yet.


;;; Orderless is handled...  (not, "If you can't eat it all, order less"  but
;;; "The universe tends toward a state without order -- orderless"..)

;;; if (say) Plus is orderless, then Plus[x_,Sin[x_]] matches
;;; Plus[3,Sin[3]] or Plus[Sin[3],3].

;;; Also allowed: x_Integer, x_foo,  or x:f[_] or x_?pred . 
;;;The form x_foo has the
;;; meaning that x's Head must be foo, or x must be of type foo.
;;;  x_foo parses into (Pattern x (Blank foo))
;;; x:f[_] parses into (Pattern x (f (Blank)))
;;; x_:pred parses into (PatternTest(Pattern x (Blank)) pred)

;; It is also possible to go into a pattern matching situation with a
;; condition specified externally, e.g. {note parens..}
;;  (x_-> f[x]) /;pred[x],  where this is parsed as
;; (Condition (Rule (Pattern x (Blank))(f x))
;;            (pred x))

;; note there can be Rule { ->} and Ruledelayed  { :> }
;; but this does not affect matching.  A Rule definition

;; the rhs is evaluated AGAIN at application time.
;; RuleDelayed means only the lhs is evaluated at defintion time.

;;; Return value for a match is  nil or non-nil.

;; a note on the data structuring.  
;; It would be possible to "abstract away" some of the cars and cdrs
;; but the representation from the parser is fairly definitive, close
;; to Mma, and unlikely to benefit from revision. Consequently it would
;; seem to be mostly coyness to pretend that we didn't know how things
;; were stored, and frankly, defining map-over-args as mapcar and
;; (head x) as (car x) gets tiresome, especially when you "pun" and
;; use argument lists as lisp lists. Of course, if we change the
;; data representation, this program will be harder to change as a
;; result of this decision.

;; a simple test function

#|note.  Many, of the subfunctions end up carrying
a condition which is a function of 0 arguments which, when
called, must return t to allow the match to succeed.  The idea is that if you are
trying to match {a_,b_,c, ...}  against {e1,e2, e3...} subject to test[a,b,c]
  then you match a to e1 subject to 
     matching {b_,c_, ...} to {e2, e3, ...}
      AND
     test[a,b,c]  evaluated with a=e1
which operates recursively for matching down the list.

At the moment the functions may also need to
know if matching is subject to attributes like Flat and Orderless.
We do this by transmitting as an argument
the Head that governs this (gh) so we can compute its attributes.

Hazardous.  Consider f[a,b,s] /.  f[x:(y:__),z___]->g[x,y,z]
need to bind x to whatever Sequence y matches.

Different semantics.

a. RuleDelayed[w_,Condition[aha,Great3[w]]]
b. Rule       [w_,Condition[aha,Great3[w]]]

When defining a rule by version a., the condition is not evaluated until after w
is bound. this is probably what you want to do.

When defining by version b, Great3[w] is never evaluated at all ??
